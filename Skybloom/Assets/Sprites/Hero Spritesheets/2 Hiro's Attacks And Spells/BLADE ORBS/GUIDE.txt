Skill conept: Summon (passively or use the buff/spell animations?) multiple orbs that circle around the player and deal damage to enemies 
that make contact with them. Once they've made contact with enemies X number of times; they could explode. Maybe they could even explode
instantly if they make contact with an enemy projectile (to protect you)?

Orb appear:		20FPS
Orb explode:		25FPS
