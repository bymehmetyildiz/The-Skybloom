This is a multi-purpose spell animation. Use it for casting buffs, etc. (Its intended to be used when
casting "sword rain"). The animation was a little long so I decided to make a shorter version just
in-case the long one felt a bit too clunky during gameplay.
Play the cast prep first, then loop the casting animation several times (depending on preference), then the end animation.


Cast prep:		25FPS
Cast loop:		20FPS
End:			20FPS
