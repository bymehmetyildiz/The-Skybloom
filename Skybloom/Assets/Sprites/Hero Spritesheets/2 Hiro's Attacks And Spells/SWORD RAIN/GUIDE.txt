Attack concept: summon a rainstorm of magic swords to devastate all on-screen enemies (long cool-down?).

Play "1 sword rain overlay FX" over the player at the same time as the "cast prep" animation from the 
magic cast/buff folder (the long version). Start raining down the "raindrop" images from the top of the scree,
then after a moment spawn the 'rain-landing tiles' on all available tiles (they should all fit into 64x64 spaces).
Hold the rain-landing animations on their last frame for a while. Apply damage to enemies at the same time that the
rain-landing tile animations start.



Sword rain prep overlay:		25FPS
Rain landing tiles:			20FPS
