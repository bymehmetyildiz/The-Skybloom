Attack concept: Become invulnerable for a moment and start spinning wildly; dealing rapid damage to everything near you (cool-down
Attack). Maybe you can move slowly while spinning?

Instead of overlays; the Player sprites are included in with the FX for these animations. 
Play "twister spin loop" on loop for as long as you desire the attack to last.



Twister prep:			33FPS
Twister spin loop:		25FPS
End:				33FPS
